Reflections for the README:
What requirements did you achieve?

I successfully implemented a working form that stores quotes in the database, and the website is functional across multiple devices with responsive CSS.
Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I wasn’t able to fully implement the feature to delete quotes, as time constraints affected backend routing for that functionality.
What was difficult about these tasks?

Ensuring that the database seeding worked correctly with the form submissions took longer than expected due to some configuration issues with Supabase and API routes.
What went well?

The quote posting functionality works smoothly, and the form validation is user-friendly. I also successfully deployed the project to Render, making it accessible online.
What could have gone better?

I would have liked to spend more time polishing the user interface, especially in terms of animation and transitions. Additionally, implementing the "favorite" quotes feature would have added more personalization to the user experience.
